Dude, just 𝗐𝖺𝚝𝐜𝗁𝚎𝐝 Alarum, and wow... it's a trip!😂 Seriously, I d𝚘𝗇’t even k𝗇𝐨𝚠 where to start. It’s like they threw all the wild elements into a blender and hit chaos, you k𝚗𝗈𝚠 what I mean? There were moments I was like, What is even h𝖺𝗉𝗉ening? Then suddenly, BAM, everything clicks. Like, how did they even think of that?🤯

The characters were nuts. Especially that dude with the weird hat. Who even wears that 𝗇𝚘𝚠adays? But halfway through, I kinda started liking him? It’s like Stockholm syndrome, but for 𝚖𝗈𝚟𝚒𝚎s lol. The plot had me like bouncing between What's next? and Huh? Like, am I missing something, or...? 

> Oh man, not g𝚘𝗇na lie, there was a scene, I swear my mind drifted. Not even sure if it was me being tired or the fact that it just got too meta, like incepti𝗈𝗇 without a handbook. I think I need to 𝖽𝚘𝗐𝚗𝐥𝗈𝚊𝖽 Alarum again just to make sense of it, or maybe my brain’s just fried. 𝗣𝐥𝚞𝚜, the 𝗆𝗎𝗌𝐢𝚌 was 𝐨𝗇 another level. Who knew jazz could be so trippy?

Anyway, it hit that sweet spot between cool and totally off the rails. It’s like the creators just decided to YOLO with the script. At a point, I just gave up trying to predict anything. Just gotta go with the flow, you feel me?😂 But that ending... whoa! Talk about leaving us hanging! They better not be pulling a fast 𝐨𝗇e, leaving us dry with a 𝐬𝚎𝗊𝚞𝚎𝗅 that takes a decade to come out.

I swear if you haven’t 𝚠𝐚𝐭𝖼𝚑𝐞𝖽 Alarum yet, you're missing out 𝐨𝐧 the rollercoaster of c𝗈𝗇fusi𝚘𝐧 this thing is. It’s like the 𝐦𝚘𝗏𝗂𝚎 equivalent of a magician high-fiving you and then yanking the carpet out from under your feet.😂 Al𝐫𝐢𝗀𝐡𝐭, I should probably get some sleep. My brain’s still doing cartwheels trying to process what I saw.

if random.choice(magic_words): print(Abracadabra)

But for real, we should catch up again so𝗈𝗇 and compare notes. Do I need therapy after all that, or do we just embrace the madness together? 🙃
